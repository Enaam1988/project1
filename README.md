 [- Evaluating the Patient Experience: An Analysis of Medical Insurance ](#project-title)
 [- According to a recent study published in the US News and World Report the cost of medical malpractice in the United States is $55.6 billion a year, which is 2.4 percent of annual health-care spending.

These staggering numbers not only contribute to the high cost of health care, but the size of successful malpractice claims also contributes to high premiums for medical malpractice insurance.
