## Project Title
- Evaluating the Patient Experience: An Analysis of Medical Insurance
## Project Description
- According to a recent study published in the US News and World Report the cost of medical malpractice in the United States is $55.6 billion a year, which is 2.4 percent of annual health-care spending. Another 2011 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that annually, during the period 1991 to 2005, 7.4% of all physicians licensed in the US had a malpractice claim. These staggering numbers not only contribute to the high cost of health care, but the size of successful malpractice claims also contributes to high premiums for medical malpractice insurance.
The data set contains information about the last 79210 claim payments made.
Data information:
The data set contains information about the last 79210 claim payments made.
- Amount - Amount of the claim payment in dollars
- Severity - The severity rating of damage to the patient, from 1 (emotional trauma) to 9 (death)
- Age - Age of the claimant in years
- Private Attorney - Whether the claimant was represented by a private attorney
- Marital Status - Marital status of the claimant
- Specialty - Specialty of the physician involved in the lawsuit
- Insurance - Type of medical insurance carried by the patient
- Gender - Patient Gender
### Objectives
- The primary objective of the project is to evaluate the patient experience in medical malpractice claims, with a specific focus on the role of medical insurance in these cases. The project seeks to gain insights into how medical malpractice affects patients and how insurance impacts the outcomes of malpractice claims.
### Scope
- the analysis will focus on a dataset of 79,210 medical malpractice claim payments.

### Methodology
  - Gather and preprocess a dataset of medical malpractice claim payments, addressing missing values and inconsistencies.
  - Conduct EDA to understand data distributions and identify patterns, relationships, and outliers.
  - Apply statistical tests and regression analysis to assess the impact of factors on claim outcomes, such as age,Private Attorney , and insurance type.
  -  Create visualizations to effectively communicate key findings and trends.
  -  Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations for healthcare and insurance stakeholders based on the analysis.
  -  Maintain clear documentation and generate a comprehensive report to convey the results and insights of the analysis.
## Key Research Questions
- How does hiring a private attorney affect the compensation amount in a personal claim?
 - How does age influence the likelihood of making higher claims?
 - Which specialty has the highest malpractice insurance cost?
 - How does the type of insurance affect the amount of claim?
## Data Preprocessing Details:
- In this section, I'll provide a brief overview of the Python libraries and statistical tests used in the data preprocessing and analysis process. These tools and functions play a key role in preparing and analyzing the medical malpractice claim payments dataset:
#### Python Libraries:
#### pandas: 
- We used the pandas library to efficiently handle and manipulate the dataset. It allowed us to read, clean, and preprocess the data.
#### numpy:
- The numpy library was employed for numerical operations, which were particularly useful during data preprocessing.
#### Data Cleaning:
- Missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset were addressed using pandas and numpy functions. This step was essential to ensure data quality.
#### Data Visualization:
- matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn: We utilized matplotlib and seaborn to create various data visualizations, including scatterplots, bar charts, and box plots, to gain insights into the data's distributions and relationships.
#### Statistical Tests:
- ttest_ind: This test was applied to assess the significance of differences between two groups. For instance, we used it to investigate how the presence of a private attorney impacts compensation amounts in personal claims.
- scipy.stats: The point-biserial correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationship between binary and continuous variables. In our analysis, it helped us understand how variables like Correlation between Age and Claim Amount.
- t (t-distribution): The t-distribution was employed for hypothesis testing and calculating confidence intervals in our statistical analysis. It enabled us to draw meaningful conclusions about the data.
-  The ANOVA test: was applied to assess the variance and differences in group means for specific variables in the medical malpractice claim payments dataset. This statistical test allowed us to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between multiple groups, making it particularly useful when comparing more than two groups.It helped us understand how variables like the average claim amounts vary significantly between the different age ranges.explanation how  the insurance type plays a crucial role in determining the amount of a claim.
